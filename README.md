- To start rendering the project, run 'render_main.py' in the source folder.
- Pay attention - the files folder must be in the same directory as the source folder - named 'files'.
- for rendering in all formats, add to 'ecg_formats' the formats you wants in 'render_main.py', for example if you want to render in format 1 and 3 add to 'ecg_formats' the numbers 1 and 3 - > ecg_formats = [1, 3]
Good luck :)
